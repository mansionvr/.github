# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

Mansion is an organization supports empathetic and friendly conversation. We do not tolerate communication that makes anyone feel unwelcome, unsupported, insulted, or discriminated against.

## Seen or experienced something uncomfortable?

If you see or experience abuse, harassment, discrimination, or feel unsafe or upset, please email moderation@treesleeper.com. We will take your report seriously.

## Enforcement

We actively monitor for Code of Conduct (CoC) violations and take any reports of violations extremely seriously. We will ban contributors, community members and staff due to violations.

After we receive a report of a CoC violation, we view that person's conversation history within Mansion and related communication channels and attempt to understand whether someone has deliberately broken the CoC, or accidentally crossed a line. We generally reach out to the person who has been reported to discuss any concerns we have and warn them that repeated violations will result in a ban. Sometimes we decide that no violation has occurred and that no action is required and sometimes we will also ban people on a first offense. We strive to be fair, but will err on the side of protecting the culture of our community.

Mansion's leadership reserve the right to take whatever action they feel appropriate with regards to CoC violations.

- Intimidation or harassment (online or in-person). Please read the [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md) for how we interpret harassment.
- Inappropriate attention or contact.
- Not understanding the differences between constructive criticism and disparagement.

These things are NOT OK.

Be aware of how your actions affect others. If it makes someone uncomfortable, stop.

If you say something that is found offensive, and you are called out on it, try to:

- Listen without interruption.
- Believe what the person is saying & do not attempt to disqualify what they have to say.
- Ask for tips / help with avoiding making the offense in the future.
- Apologize and ask forgiveness.
